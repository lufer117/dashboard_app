  "Compare by Metric": "There is a massive disparity in Total Pulls between locations. Store A represents the vast majority of pulls at 98.43%, while Store B accounts for a mere 1.57%. Overall performance is concentrated in one location and shows weak contribution from the second.\n\n**Key Insight:** Total Pulls are almost exclusively driven by Store A, suggesting a potential issue or significant difference in operations at Store B that requires investigation.",
  "Compare by Location": "Total pulls and fills are very high, nearly equivalent, while SKU count and cooler count are very low. The number of OOS incidents is also significantly high compared to the SKU and cooler counts.\n\n**Key Insight:** Despite high activity in pulls and fills, a high number of Out-of-Stock incidents indicate a potential problem in inventory management or restocking efficiency.",
  "General Comparison": "Store A's metrics are all significantly higher than Store B's. Store A has high performance, especially in Out of Stock incidents.\n\nKey Insight: Store A demonstrates very strong operational performance, contrasting sharply with Store B's relatively low values across all measured metrics.",
  "Compare by Metric - Total Pulls": "Store A is a **strong performer** and accounts for the vast majority of total pulls. Store B is a **weak performer**, representing a very small portion of total pulls. The trend clearly shows a significant disparity in total pulls between the two locations.\n\n**Key Insight: Store A significantly outperforms Store B in total pulls.**",
  "Compare by Metric - OOS Incidents": "Store A experiences significantly higher OOS Incidents compared to Store B.\n\nStore B is a strong performer with minimal OOS Incidents.\n\n**Key Insight: A stark disparity exists in OOS Incidents between the two locations, demanding an investigation into the root causes at Store A.**",
  "Compare by Metric - Coolers Count": "Both Store A and Store B have the same **Coolers Count**. There is no strong or weak performer.\n\n**Key Insight: Coolers Count is consistent across all locations.**",
  "Compare by Location - Store A": "Store A's metrics show a significant imbalance. **Total Pulls (96,716) are very high,** and Total Fills at 97,147 slightly exceeds the pulls. While the store has a limited **SKU count of 20 and 5 coolers**, a concerningly **high number of Out-of-Stock (OOS) incidents at 3,146** overshadows the positive fill rate.\n\n**Key Insight:** Although the fill rate is strong, frequent stockouts for the limited SKUs suggest major inefficiencies in inventory management, forecasting, or supply chain responsiveness, negatively impacting potential sales and customer satisfaction.",
  "Compare by Metric - SKU Count": "Store A demonstrates a **significantly higher** SKU count compared to Store B. Store B is a **weak performer**.\n\n**Key Insight: Store A vastly outperforms Store B in SKU count, suggesting a possible discrepancy in inventory management or store strategy.**",
  "Compare by Metric - Total Fills": "Store A significantly outperforms Store B in **Total Fills**. Store A is operating at a very high percentage, while Store B is very low.\n\n**Key Insight: There is a significant disparity in Total Fills between Store A and Store B, warranting investigation into the factors contributing to the underperformance of Store B.**",
  "Compare by Location - Store B": "Store B shows a **high level of efficiency** in fulfilling orders.\n\nStandout figures show **high total fills (1991)** which are well above the total pulls of 1540.\nThe OOS incidents and low SKU count are minimal.\n\n**Key Insight:** Store B is excelling at meeting demand with minimal out-of-stock issues, indicating strong inventory management and efficient operations. The higher fill rate compared to pull rate indicates the store is likely fulfilling existing orders and possibly pre-filling upcoming orders."
