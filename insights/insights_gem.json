  "Store B": {
    "General Restocking Data": "Store B experienced **723** total restock incidents with **1991** products restocked in total. The average time between restocks is approximately **4.99** hours, resulting in about **4.76** restocks per day. On average, **13.10** products are restocked daily, while about **10.13** products are pulled each day. **Key Insight**",
    "General OOS Data": "The average OOS duration is **8.25 hours**, with an OOS frequency of **0.03 per day**, and **4 total OOS incidents.**\n\n**Key Insight:** With such a low OOS frequency, the long average OOS duration suggests slow response times for restocking after an item runs out. This may indicate logistical or staffing issues.",
    "General Overview Pulls": "Store B represents a small fraction, only **1.57%**, of the total pulls when compared to other locations.\n\n**Key Insight:** Store B appears to have very little impact on overall pull distribution. Investigate why the demand is so low compared to other locations to optimize inventory and operations.",
    "General Product Velocity": "The reduced daily pull rate over the full period compared to active days suggests some inventory challenges. It's likely that stockouts or intermittent non-active days reduced the average, indicating opportunity to optimize stocking levels and availability to match active-day demand across the entire period.",
    "General Indexes Analysis": "The provided radar chart does not show any data points for any SKUs or coolers, only the axis labels. It's impossible to determine relative performance or highlight insights about operational inefficiencies.\n\n**Key Insight:** Insufficient data is available to determine high/low performers for Store B's coolers.",
    "PV by Shelf": "The marked differences between active and period velocities suggest that the affected SKUs commonly face out-of-stock situations.\n*   Shelf 8 shows the highest velocity when stocked but drops closer to the average, suggesting potential stockouts or inconsistent availability.\n*   Shelf 6 and Shelf 10 also show a significant difference between their active and period velocities.\n\nKey Insight: The observed velocity fluctuations suggest an opportunity to improve inventory management by aligning stock levels with periods of high demand and addressing potential supply chain inconsistencies to ensure continuous product availability.",
    "Pulls by All SKUs": "Product 15 accounts for **92.79%** of total pulls, far exceeding the average of **20.00%**, while the remaining products have significantly lower percentages. **Key Insight**",
    "Pulls by Top 10 SKU": "- **Product 15** dominates with **92.79%** of total pulls, significantly above the average of **20%**.\n- **Product 8** pulls are **4.03%**, also over the average.\n- Together, Product 15 and Product 8 make up the vast majority of pulls.\n\n**Key Insight:** Store B's pull distribution is heavily concentrated on one item. Operations should focus on ensuring adequate stock of Product 15 to avoid stockouts and analyze why its pull rate is so disproportionately high.",
    "OOS by Top 10 Sku": "**Product 15** experiences a significantly above-average restocking frequency, alongside an above-average OOS duration.\n\n**Key Insight: The high restocking frequency of Product 15 doesn't prevent a long OOS duration, indicating that either restocking is too slow or that quantities are insufficient. Review the restocking process and replenishment quantities for Product 15.**",
    "Pulls by Shelf": "The pull distribution across shelves is fairly balanced.\n\n- **Shelf 10** shows a slightly higher pull rate at **21.17%**, above the average of **20%**.\n- **Shelf 9** has the lowest pull rate, at **18.44%**.\n\n**Key Insight:** Although the total pulls by shelf are very similar, optimizing the placement of items on Shelf 9 by experimenting with more popular items may improve overall pull rates.",
    "PV by All SKUs": "*   Product 15 has significantly higher pull velocity, leading the pack, while Product 8 is second highest.\n*   Products 6, 7, 24, and 8 have a substantially lower period velocity compared to their active day velocity, suggesting they are likely out-of-stock frequently or are inconsistently stocked.\n\nKey Insight: The dramatic difference in period versus active day velocity for several products indicates potential stock management issues that are depressing overall product movement. Product 15 is pulling significantly from the period average.",
    "Index by Top 10 Sku": "- **Product 15** exhibits high performance with a **2.57** Velocity-to-Restock Ratio and a **2.61** Pulls per Fill, but its OOS-to-Restock Ratio and OOS Duration per Fill are both **0**.\n- All products have **0** OOS-to-Restock Ratio and OOS Duration per Fill, which could indicate that restocking strategies are working or data quality issues.\n\n**Key Insight:** All top 10 products have 0 OOS to Restock. Further investigation is needed to validate the OOS-to-Restock data; if accurate, **Product 15** requires focus to ensure the restocking frequency is manageable relative to demand and labor costs.",
    "OOS by All SKUs": "**Product 15** experiences significantly higher restocking frequency and average OOS duration than other products.\n\n**Key Insight:** The high restocking frequency for **Product 15**, combined with its long average OOS duration, suggests that restocking is likely insufficient to meet demand or is not happening quickly enough after an OOS event. The restocking process for **Product 15** should be reviewed to reduce OOS duration.",
    "Index by Shelf": "*   **Shelf 8** has a high Velocity-to-Restock Ratio at **1.18**, indicating high product turnover. It also has zero OOS-to-Restock issues, but a high Pulls per Fill at **1.45**.\n*   **Shelf 6** has a low Velocity-to-Restock Ratio at **0.88**, zero OOS-to-Restock issues, and a relatively low Pulls per Fill at **1.01**, possibly indicating slow product turnover.\n*   **Shelf 10** has a Velocity-to-Restock Ratio of **1.03**. It also has some OOS-to-Restock issues (**0.01**) and relatively low OOS Duration per Fill (**0.39**). Its Pulls per Fill is **1.3**.\n\n**Key Insight:** Prioritize investigation on **Shelf 6** due to its significantly lower Velocity-to-Restock Ratio relative to the other shelves. Look into whether the products on this shelf have lower demand or if there are inventory issues affecting the restocking process. Also, examine **Shelf 10** due to the OOS-to-Restock issues.",
    "Index by All SKUs": "*   **Product 15** demonstrates a very high **Velocity-to-Restock Ratio** at **2.57** and **Pulls per Fill** at **2.61**, with a reported **OOS-to-Restock Ratio** of **0**.\n*   **Product 6** has the lowest **Velocity-to-Restock Ratio** at **0.22** and also a relatively low **Pulls per Fill** at **0.33**.\n*   All products report a **0** for **OOS-to-Restock Ratio**, this is likely skewing the performance overview.\n\n**Key Insight:** Product 15 moves rapidly, requiring attention to ensure continuous stock availability and assess if its pulls per fill are manageable. Product 6 is moving slowly and might need assessment to determine if it should be removed or if placement/promotion can boost its velocity. The **OOS-to-Restock Ratio** should be validated.",
    "OOS by Shelf": "- **Shelf 10** shows a slight OOS frequency (0.01) and a **high average OOS duration** of **0.20** hours relative to other shelves.\n- **Shelf 6, 7, 8, and 9** have little to no OOS frequency, indicating a strong level of performance.\n\n**Key Insight:** Prioritize investigation into **Shelf 10**. While its OOS frequency is low, the fact that the average duration is elevated suggests issues with restocking efficiency when an OOS event *does* occur. There could be systematic delays in the restocking process for items on this shelf.",
    "Restocking by Shelf": "Shelves are restocked at the same frequency, around **0.2** times per day. The average time between restocks increases from roughly **40** hours to **200** hours, while the number of products restocked decreases from about **0.54** to **0.52**. The average daily pulls vary by shelf, rising to **0.13** on Shelf 7 and then falling to **0.01** by Shelf 6. **Key Insight:**",
    "Restocking by All SKUs": "*   **Product 15** is restocked far more frequently, about **0.8** times per day, compared to the average, and aligns with high average daily products restocked and average daily pulls.\n*   **Product 8** is restocked slightly less frequently, and has low average daily products restocked and average daily pulls.\n*   **Product 6** shows high time between restocks, but very low average daily products restocked and average daily pulls.\n\n**Key Insight:** The restocking strategy for **Product 15** is more frequent and aligns with demand, while the strategy for **Product 6** has long delays between restocks and low average daily products restocked and average daily pulls, and should be reviewed for potential adjustments, considering its current demand.",
    "Restocking by Top 10 Sku": "*   **Product 15** is restocked far more frequently at **0.8** times per day compared to the average of **0.1**, and its average daily pulls and restocked volumes are quite high.\n*   **Product 6** shows low restocking frequency and very low pulls, suggesting minimal demand.\n*   **Product 6** and **Product 7** both have relatively long times between restocks, with **Product 6** having a much higher average time between restocks (hours) when compared to all other products.\n\n**Key Insight:** **Product 15's** restocking strategy seems successful, but the restock strategy for **Product 6** and **Product 7** needs revisiting. Consider whether **Product 6** is overstocked, or whether **Product 7** sees fluctuations in demand causing stockouts between infrequent restocks.",
    "PV by Top 10 Sku": "*   Product 15 is the clear leader in terms of pulls per day.\n*   Products 8, 24, 7, and 6 show a substantial drop off between active day velocity and period velocity suggesting intermittent OOS or stocking issues.\n\nThe average velocity for the period is heavily influenced by Product 15's strong performance. The significant difference between active day and period velocity across multiple SKUs indicates highly inconsistent demand fulfillment, potentially leading to lost sales due to stockouts."
