# Dashboard App (Generalized Analysis)

This is a generalized version of a Streamlit dashboard developed to analyze product movement, restocking efficiency, out-of-stock patterns, and performance indexes across multiple coolers and SKUs in retail environments.

> **Disclaimer**: The original application was built for a real client with shelf-installed sensors capturing product telemetry. For this version, **all sensitive data has been anonymized or synthetically generated** for illustrative purposes.

---

## Features

- **Product Consumption Overview**: Total pulls by location, SKU, and cooler.
- **Product Velocity**: Pulls per day (active vs full period), including shelf- and cooler-level detail.
- **Restocking Metrics**: Frequency, average fill volume, and time between restocks.
- **Out-of-Stock (OOS) Monitoring**: Tracks duration and frequency of OOS events by SKU and cooler.
- **Performance Indexes**: Includes OOS-to-Restock ratio, Pulls per Fill, and other operational KPIs.
- **AI-Powered Insights (Gemini)**:
  - General insights were generated by integrating **Gemini API** within a Google Colab environment.
  - Per-chart insights can also be triggered (disabled in this public version to avoid billing requirements for Vertex AI).
  - Images from the app are analyzed visually by Gemini to provide interpretive summaries.

## Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Go to [https://share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and deploy your repo.
3. In **Secrets**, add your Gemini API key:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
[api_keys]
gemini = "your-api-key-here"
```

---

## Local Development

To run locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run CanteenApp.py
```

You’ll also need a local secrets file:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
[api_keys]
gemini = "your-api-key-here"
```

---

## Notes

- Gemini insights are optional and controlled via the `ENABLE_GEMINI` flag.
- This public version is designed for demonstration; the real deployment includes Vertex AI integration, active APIs, and real-time telemetry.

**Purpose**:  
This dashboard illustrates how data from in-store sensors can be transformed into meaningful operational insights using a combination of visualization, analytics, and generative AI. It is intended for demo purposes only.
